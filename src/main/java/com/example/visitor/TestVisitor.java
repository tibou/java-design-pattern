    Behavioral design pattern

    Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects. With the help of visitor pattern,
    we can move the operational logic from the objects to another class. For example, think of a Shopping cart where we can add different
    type of items (Elements). When we click on checkout button, it calculates the total amount to be paid. Now we can have the calculation
    logic in item classes or we can move out this logic to another class using visitor pattern. Letâ€™s implement this in our example of visitor pattern.

    Visitor Pattern Benefits
    The benefit of this pattern is that if the logic of operation changes, then we need to make change only in the visitor implementation rather
    than doing it in all the item classes. Another benefit is that adding a new item to the system is easy, it will require change only in visitor
    interface and implementation and existing item classes will not be affected.

    Visitor Pattern Limitations
    The drawback of visitor pattern is that we should know the return type of visit() methods at the time of designing otherwise we will have to
    change the interface and all of its implementations. Another drawback is that if there are too many implementations of visitor interface, it
    makes it hard to extend. Thats all for visitor design pattern, let me know if I have missed anything. Please share it with others also if you
    liked it.
